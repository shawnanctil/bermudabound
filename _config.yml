title: Bermuda Bound
description: This is a development and publishing environment for Neil Kennedy's Bermuda Bound project. Bermuda Bound follows the flight and the hunt for Patrick Williams--a Bermudian slave who escaped from his captors in 1833 in an act of self-emancipation. It's a journey that takes us from Bermuda to the multi-ethnic dockyards of New York, and finally to Louisiana. This project is an attempt to reconstruct Patrick Williams' story in order to better understand the role of place and contingency in the Abolitionist Atlantic. Check back for updates.
